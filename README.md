Clubbing Buddy is a website aimed to help club-goers, ravers and people with an interest in music festivals and gigs, to find companions to go to such events with. The visitors will be given the options to open an account and have a profile that diplays the events they are planning to attend, as well as being able to see what events other users are going to. Think of how many times you have wanted to go to a gig but had no one to go with, or perhaps your partner or friend/s let you down very short notice? This platform could well be the solution to that last minute problem.

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience

Clubbing Buddy allow users to create an account and have personal login credentials. Once fully registered, users can submit forms with the corresponding information about the event they are planning to attend. Users can have visibility of other users profiles in order to connect with them and, potentially, go to events together.

## User stories

-  ### <h3>First Time Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to take a first look at the website and evaluate its functionalities.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to open an account and have my own login credentials.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to get in touch with other users of the platform.

-  ### <h3>Returning Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to submit an event I am planning to attend.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to check other events and see whether there are any that match with my preferences.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to edit/delete some of my events in my account.

## Design

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I wanted to keep the design of the website simple and neat. I have applied a slider to be the main background of the homepage, and that contains 4 of my own pictures which I downloaded from the website <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>. Please see below:

I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching, and that does not take the attention of the user away from the main goal of the website. 

<img src="assets/images/colours.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

There are 2 dominant colours that can be identified on my site:

- <strong>Orange Darken 4 (#e65100)</strong> : Used as the background colour for the header, footer and all the buttons but the ones in the searh box that sits above all the events in #all_events.html 
- <strong>Color Hex (#212121)</strong> : Used as the colour of the text displayed on the header, footer and all the rest of the content in the website

- ### <h3>Typography</h3>

The font I used for all the website is "M PLUS Rounded 1c".

## Testing

 The following tools were utilised to test the website:

 - [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com/)

 The results of such test can be seen as below:

 <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jose-cloudinary/image/upload/v1632308032/toolspingdom_test_hsujp3.png" width="400" height="300" />

 - [W3C CSS Validator - Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
 - [W3C Markup Validator - Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

 In regards to the HTML markup, I encountered one error that even though it did not affect the functionality of the site, it was marked as non-valid code, see below:

 <img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/errorhtml.PNG" width="1000" height="300" />

 After trying numerous types of fixes, I eventually managed to cut some code from [Bootstrap navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/dropdowns/) and embedded it onto my existing navbar code I previously extracted from Bootstrap. The problem of a div element being a child of an ul was solved
 by changing the div element by a li, which will perfectly fit as a child of an ul. My original classes and id's were kept as they did not need to change at all.

 You can check my clean, no-errors HTML [here](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

 In regards to the CSS, no errors. Please see below: 

 <img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/cssresults.PNG" width="1000" height="300" />

 - [Responsive Web Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

 The website has been tested in various devices and I have also used the dev tools to make sure that the site renders adequately on all the breakpoints.

### Final layout

 - Home Page: I introduced the carousel slider instead of a static photo, as per my wireframe I drew back when I was starting the project.
 - Shop: I deployed a dropdown menu with all the sections of the shop, rather than displaying them all on a single page.
